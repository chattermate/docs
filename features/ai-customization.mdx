    ## Rate Limiting

    ### Enable Rate Limiting
    Configure rate limiting to protect your agent from abuse and control traffic:

    ### Daily Limit
    - Set maximum requests per IP address per day
    - Range: 10-1000 requests
    - Prevents abuse from single sources

    ### Rate Limit
    - Control requests per second
    - Range: 1-10 requests per second
    - Manages traffic flow and server load

    <Note>
    Rate limiting helps prevent abuse while ensuring legitimate users maintain access to support.
    </Note>

</Tabs>

## Workflow Mode

When using **Workflow** mode, your agent operates using predefined workflows instead of AI-generated responses. This provides:

- **Structured Conversations**: Guide users through specific paths
- **Conditional Logic**: Route conversations based on user inputs
- **Automation**: Trigger actions based on conversation flow
- **Consistency**: Ensure standardized responses for common scenarios

<Note>
Switch between AI Mode and Workflow using the toggle buttons at the top of the agent configuration.
