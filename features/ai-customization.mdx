## Agent Configuration

### Display Name
- Choose a friendly, professional name for your AI agent
- This name will be visible to customers in the chat widget
- Example: "David", "Sarah", "Alex"

### Status Management
- Toggle agent between Online/Offline states
- Offline agents won't accept new conversations
- Status is clearly displayed to customers

### Transfer to Human
Enable or disable automatic transfer to human agents when:
- AI agent can't handle the query
- Customer specifically requests human support
- Complex issues require human intervention

<Note>
During off-hours (outside business hours), even if transfer is enabled, the AI agent will inform customers that human support is unavailable until the next business day.
</Note>

## Agent Instructions
