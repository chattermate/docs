### Ticket Creation Triggers

Configure when tickets should be automatically created in Jira:

- Issues without immediate resolution
- No transfer agent available
- Transfer requests not attended
- Customer follow-ups
- Complex issues requiring tracking

<Tip>
You can enable or disable automatic ticket creation for each agent individually, allowing for specialized handling based on agent roles and responsibilities.
</Tip>
