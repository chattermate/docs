## Workflow Management

### Workflow States

**Draft**: 
- Workflow is being created or edited
- Not active for live conversations
- Changes can be made freely

**Published**:
- Workflow is live and handling conversations
- Users interact with the published version
- Editing requires creating a new draft

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic flows and add complexity gradually
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the preview feature to test all conversation paths
3. **Plan User Journeys**: Map out expected user interactions before building
4. **Use Clear Naming**: Give nodes descriptive names for easy maintenance
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Include fallback paths for unexpected user behavior
6. **Regular Updates**: Keep workflows current with business changes

### Advanced Features

**Variable Management**:
- Store and use data collected throughout the conversation
- Pass information between nodes
- Use variables in conditions and messages

**Integration Capabilities**:
- Connect to external APIs and services
- Trigger webhooks and notifications
- Database operations and data storage

**Analytics and Monitoring**:
- Track user progress through workflows
- Identify bottlenecks and drop-off points
- Measure conversion rates and success metrics

<Note>
Workflows provide powerful automation capabilities while maintaining the flexibility to handle complex conversation scenarios. Start with simple flows and gradually build more sophisticated interactions as you become familiar with the system.
