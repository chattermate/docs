## Adding Knowledge Sources

ChatterMate supports multiple ways to add knowledge to your AI agents:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="PDF Upload" icon="file-pdf">
    Upload PDF documentation, guides, and manuals
  </Card>
  <Card title="URL Import" icon="link">
    Import knowledge from web pages and documentation sites
  </Card>
  <Card title="Link Existing" icon="link-simple">
    Share knowledge sources between multiple agents
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Knowledge Sharing

ChatterMate allows multiple agents to share common knowledge sources through the "Link Existing" feature:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Link Existing" icon="link-simple">
    Connect agents to existing knowledge sources
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared Access" icon="share-nodes">
    Multiple agents can reference the same knowledge
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Benefits of Knowledge Sharing
- Maintain consistency across different agent types
- Reduce duplicate content processing
- Centralized knowledge management
- Easy updates propagate to all linked agents

### Use Cases
- Share company policies across all agents
- Common product documentation for sales and support
- Technical specifications for multiple specialist agents
- FAQ content for general and specialized support

<Note>
When you update a shared knowledge source, all agents linked to it will automatically have access to the updated information without requiring reprocessing.
</Note>

## Knowledge Processing

### Batch Processing
ChatterMate processes knowledge sources in batches to ensure system stability:

- Maximum 20 subpages per batch
- Processing occurs every 5 minutes
- Queued items are processed in FIFO order
- Status tracking for each knowledge source

<Note>
Knowledge processing includes text extraction, chunking, embedding generation, and vector database indexing. This ensures optimal retrieval during customer interactions.
</Note>

### Processing States

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Queued">
    - Knowledge source is waiting to be processed
    - Part of the next available batch
    - Shows position in queue
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Processing">
    - Currently being analyzed and indexed
    - Includes text extraction and embedding
    - Progress indicator available
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Completed">
    - Successfully processed and indexed
    - Available for AI agent use
    - Shows completion timestamp
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Failed">
    - Error during processing
    - Detailed error message
    - Option to retry processing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Notifications

When Firebase Cloud Messaging is enabled:

<CodeGroup>
```json Success
{
  "title": "Knowledge Processing Complete",
  "body": "Your knowledge source '[filename]' has been successfully processed",
  "type": "knowledge_processed"
}
```

```json Error
{
  "title": "Knowledge Processing Failed",
  "body": "Failed to process '[filename]'. Click for details",
  "type": "knowledge_failed"
}
```
</CodeGroup>

- Notifications are sent only when processing completes
- Success and failure states are reported
- Click notification to view details
- Configurable notification preferences

## Knowledge Source Management

### Source Types
- PDF Documents
- Web Pages
- HTML Content
- Markdown Files
- Plain Text

### Source Details
Each knowledge source shows:
- Source name/URL
- Number of subpages
- Creation date
- Processing status
- Last updated timestamp

## Best Practices

1. **Document Preparation**
   - Use clear, well-structured documents
   - Break large documents into smaller sections
   - Ensure text is extractable from PDFs
   - Keep URLs accessible and stable

2. **Processing Management**
   - Monitor queue status
   - Process during off-peak hours
   - Keep documents under 100MB
   - Use consistent formatting

3. **Content Organization**
   - Group related documents
   - Use descriptive filenames
   - Update outdated content
   - Remove obsolete sources

## Limitations

<Warning>
- Maximum 20 subpages per batch
- Processing occurs every 5 minutes
- PDF size limit: 100MB
- URL must be publicly accessible
- Text must be extractable (no scanned PDFs)
</Warning>

## Monitoring Progress

Track knowledge processing through:
1. Dashboard status indicators
2. Firebase notifications (if enabled)
3. Processing history logs
4. Error reports and retry options

## What's Next?

After adding knowledge sources:

1. Test AI responses with new knowledge
2. Monitor response accuracy
3. Update content as needed
4. Configure notification preferences
