## Configuration Fields

### AI Provider
Select your preferred AI provider from the dropdown menu. Each provider has its own strengths:
- **OpenAI** (Recommended): Best-in-class models with consistent performance
- **Anthropic**: Strong reasoning and analysis capabilities
- **Google**: Integrated with Google's ecosystem
- **Others**: Specialized use cases and self-hosting options

### Model Name
Enter the model identifier for your chosen provider. Our recommendations:

<CodeGroup>
```bash OpenAI (Recommended)
gpt-4-0125-preview  # Latest GPT-4 Turbo
gpt-4               # Standard GPT-4
gpt-3.5-turbo      # Cost-effective option
```

```bash Anthropic
claude-3-opus       # Most capable
claude-3-sonnet    # Balanced performance
claude-3-haiku     # Fast and efficient
```

```bash Google
gemini-pro         # Latest Gemini model
vertex-ai          # Enterprise-grade option
```
</CodeGroup>

### API Key
Your provider's API key for authentication. Security measures:
- Keys are encrypted before storage
- Keys are never logged or exposed in plaintext
- Access is restricted to authorized systems only
- Regular key rotation is supported
- Compliance with SOC 2 standards

<Note>
  Never share your API keys or commit them to version control. ChatterMate encrypts and stores them securely.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Provider Selection**
   - Start with OpenAI's GPT-4 for best overall performance
   - Consider Anthropic's Claude for complex reasoning tasks
   - Use Ollama for self-hosted deployments

2. **Model Choice**
   - Balance between capability and cost
   - Test different models before production
   - Monitor usage and adjust as needed

3. **Security**
   - Use environment-specific API keys
   - Rotate keys periodically
   - Monitor usage for anomalies
